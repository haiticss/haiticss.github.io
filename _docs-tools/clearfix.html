<hr>

<p>This tool includes a mixin to drop micro clearfix into a selector, in a cross browser way.</p>
<p>In the same way, there are a mixin to unset the clearfix, which is useful to crate clearfix only in a certain breakpoint.</p>
<p>Finally contains the same two mixins but in a important mode...we are not proud to have it, but sometimes could be necessary...</p>
