<p>Define the font families collection that will be used in the other layers.</p>
<p>By default exists 3 font families, named as Primary, Secondary and Accent. The foundation includes a fallback font as well, used when the primary font families are not available in the client.</p>
<p>All the default fonts are system fonts, but could be replaced by any other ones, like Google Fonts including the necessary style sheets.</p>
